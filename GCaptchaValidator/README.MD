## GCaptchaValidator - A ReCaptcha 2.0 Validator

### What is GCaptchaValidator?

GCaptchaValidator is a lightweight Java library to verify a users is a valid human.
When developing a web application server, it is possible that a users action (like submitting
a form) should be validated to avoid bots from spam. A client-side validation isn't enough at this point,
because small changes in the JavaScript are enough to bypass the cpatcha.

If you create a web application you can easily verify a Google ReCaptcha with this library.
All the background work like creating the request to google or processing the JSon result
is handled by GCaptchaValidator.

### How to use GCaptchaValidator

Else:

like all other libraries.
