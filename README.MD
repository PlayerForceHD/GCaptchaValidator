## GCaptchaValidator - A ReCaptcha 2.0 Validator [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/PlayerForceHD/GCaptchaValidator.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/PlayerForceHD/GCaptchaValidator)

### What is GCaptchaValidator?

GCaptchaValidator is a lightweight Java library to verify a user is a valid human.
When developing a web application server, it is possible that a user action (like submitting
a form) should be validated to avoid bots from spam. A client-side validation isn't enough at this point,
because small changes in the JavaScript are enough to bypass a captcha.

If you create a web application you can easily verify a Google ReCaptcha validation with this library.
All the background work like sending the request to google or processing the JSon result
is handled by GCaptchaValidator.

This supports Google ReCaptcha 2.0 and the Invisible ReCaptcha by Google (Both have the same server-side validation process)

### How to use GCaptchaValidator

#### Installation

If you're using Maven:
```xml

<!-- GCaptchaValidator - Simple Google ReCpatcha 2.0 validation -->
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.github.playerforcehd</groupId>
    <artifactId>gcaptchavalidator</artifactId>
    <version>2.0.0</version>
    <scope>compile</scope>
</dependency>
    
```

Else:
~~Download a release from GitHub and add it to your project,
like all other libraries.~~

Support for manual downloads has been dropped with version 2.0.0, please use maven or build on your local machine!

**NOTE: GCaptchaValidator requires at least Java 7.**

#### How to use it

Step 1.
Create a CaptchaValidationConfiguration and set the information needed for the validation.
The values 'secret' and 'response' are required.
The value 'remoteIP' is optional.
For more information about the values take a look at Googles
ReCaptcha 2.0 API documentation.

```java

// Create the configuration for the request
CaptchaValidationConfiguration captchaValidationConfiguration = GCaptchaValidator.createConfigurationBuilder()
    .withSecret("xxxxYourSecretxxxx")
    .build();

```

Step 2. Creating a CaptchaValidationRequest and fetch a result
After creating the configuration you need a request which can be fetched.
To create a CaptchaValidationRequest you have to call the 'GCaptchaValidator#createRequest' method.
Then fetch a result asynchronous or synchronous through the 'fetch####' method.
After fetching the result you can get the result through the gathered 'CaptchaValidationResult' object.

```java

// Create the request which will be executed
CaptchaValidationRequest captchaValidationRequest = GCaptchaValidator.createRequest(captchaValidationConfiguration);

// Fetching a result synchronous
try {
    ListenableFuture<CaptchaValidationResult> futureResult = captchaValidationRequest.validate("xxxxYourResponsexxxx");
    CaptchaValidationResult synchronousResult = futureResult.get();
    // Do anything with your result, like checking if the request was a success
    if(synchronousResult.isValid()){
        System.out.println("Yeah! valid response. Captcha was really filled out by the user!");
    }
} catch (IOException | CaptchaValidationException e) {
    // Anything went wrong
    e.printStackTrace();
}

// Fetching a value asynchronous
FutureCallback<CaptchaValidationResult> resultCallback = new FutureCallback<CaptchaValidationResult>() {
    @Override
    public void onSuccess(@Nullable CaptchaValidationResult result) {
        // Do anything with your result, like checking if the request was a success
        if(asynchronousResult.isValid()){
            System.out.println("Yeah! valid response. Captcha was really filled out by the user!");
        }
    }
    @Override
    public void onFailure(Throwable throwable) {
        throwable.printStackTrace();
        // Anything went wrong
    }
};
ListenableFuture<CaptchaValidationResult> futureResult = captchaValidationRequest.validate("xxxxYourResponsexxxx");
captchaValidationRequest.addFutureCallback(futureResult, resultCallback);

```

That's all what this library does.
It simplifies the validation of a Google ReCaptcha 2.0 request
in Java.
