## GCaptchaValidator - A ReCaptcha 2.0 Validator [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/PlayerForceHD/GCaptchaValidator.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/PlayerForceHD/GCaptchaValidator)

### What is GCaptchaValidator?

GCaptchaValidator is a lightweight Java library to verify a users is a valid human.
When developing a web application server, it is possible that a users action (like submitting
a form) should be validated to avoid bots from spam. A client-side validation isn't enough at this point,
because small changes in the JavaScript are enough to bypass the cpatcha.

If you create a web application you can easily verify a Google ReCaptcha with this library.
All the background work like creating the request to google or processing the JSon result
is handled by GCaptchaValidator.

### How to use GCaptchaValidator

#### Installation

If you're using Maven:
```xml

    <!-- GCaptchaValidator - Simple Google ReCpatcha 2.0 validation -->
    <dependency>
        <groupId>com.github.playerforcehd</groupId>
        <artifactId>gcaptchavalidator</artifactId>
        <version>2.0.0</version>
        <scope>compile</scope>
     </dependency>
    
```

Else:
Download a release from GitHub and add it to your project,
like all other libraries.

#### How to use it

Step 1.
Create a CaptchaValidationConfiguration and set the information needed for the validation.
The values 'secret' and 'response' are required.
The value 'remoteIP' is optional.
For more information about the values take a look at Googles
ReCaptcha 2.0 API documentation.

```java

// Create the configuration for the request
        CaptchaValidationConfiguration captchaValidationConfiguration = GCaptchaValidator.createConfigurationBuilder()
                .withSecret("xxxxYourSecretxxxx")
                .build();

```

Step 2. Creating a CaptchaValidationRequest and fetch a result
After creating the configuration you need a request which can be fetched.
To create a CaptchaValidationRequest you have to call the 'GCaptchaValidator#createRequest' method.
Then fetch a result asynchronous or synchronous through the 'fetch####' method.
After fetching the result you can get the result through the gathered 'CaptchaValidationResult' object.

```java

// Create the request which will be executed
        CaptchaValidationRequest captchaValidationRequest = GCaptchaValidator.createRequest(captchaValidationConfiguration);

        // Fetching a value synchronous
        // It's also possible to use fetchSync("xxxYourResponsexxxx") to prevent yourself from creating
        // more than one request objects. But it is your choice :)
        try {
            Future<CaptchaValidationResult> futureResult = captchaValidationRequest.fetch("xxxxYourResponsexxxx");
            CaptchaValidationResult synchronousResult = futureResult.get();
            // Do anything with your result, like checking if the request was a success
            if(synchronousResult.isValid()){
                System.out.println("Yeah! valid response. Captcha was really filled out by the user!");
            }
        } catch (IOException | CaptchaValidationException e) {
            // Anything went wrong
            e.printStackTrace();
        }

        // Fetching a value asynchronous
        // It's also possible to use fetchAsync(callback, "xxxYourResponsexxxx") to prevent yourself from creating
        // more than one request objects. But it is your choice :)
        captchaValidationRequest.fetch("xxxxYourResponsexxxx", new Callback<CaptchaValidationResult>() {
            @Override
            public void invoke(CaptchaValidationResult asynchronousResult) {
                // Do anything with your result, like checking if the request was a success
                if(asynchronousResult.isValid()){
                    System.out.println("Yeah! valid response. Captcha was really filled out by the user!");
                }
            }

            @Override
            public void fail(Throwable throwable) {
                throwable.printStackTrace();
                // Anything went wrong
            }
        });

```

That's all what this library does.
It simplifies the validation of a Google ReCaptcha 2.0
in Java.
