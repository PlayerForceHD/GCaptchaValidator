/**
 * Represents a single response of a request that was send to the siteverify servers.
 * <p>
 * The response contains all currently defined fields as stated in Googles documentation.
 * Although, the mapping of the fields is a bit different to make it easier to work with the
 * received response on developers side.
 * <p>
 * Mapping used by ReCaptcha Validator:
 * - success          - succeeded
 * - challenge_ts     - challengeTimestamp
 * - hostname         - hostnameOrPackageName in conjunction with clientType
 * - apk_package_name - hostnameOrPackageName in conjunction with clientType
 * - score            - score
 * - action           - action
 * - errors           - errors
 * <p>
 * The mapped fields are accessed through their getters:
 * - succeeded             - {@link #hasSucceeded()}
 * - challenge_ts          - {@link #getChallengeTimestamp()}
 * - clientType            - {@link #getClientType()}
 * - hostnameOrPackageName - {@link #getHostnameOrPackageName()}
 * - score  - {@link #getScore()}
 * - action - {@link #getAction()}
 * - errors                - {@link #getErrors()}
 * <p>
 * The mapping for hostname and apk_package_name works as the following:
 * - If the hostname key is present, {@link #getClientType()} will contain {@link ClientType#WEB }
 * and {@link #getHostnameOrPackageName()} the hostname value of the response.
 * - If the apk_package_name key is present, {@link #getClientType()} will contain {@link ClientType#ANDROID }
 * and {@link #getHostnameOrPackageName()} the android package name value of the response.
 * - If both values are available, the response won't happen as the request will have been failed
 * with an exception as the mapping cannot be applied.
 * <p>
 * The version 3 relevant attributes will only be set if data has been retrieved.
 * Values from version 3 can be ignored when the version is set to
 * {@link com.github.playerforcehd.gcaptchavalidator.data.ReCaptchaVersion#VERSION_2}.
 * <p>
 * Note that responses with errors will always have {@link ReCaptchaVersion#VERSION_2} as version.
 * <p>
 * An instantiated {@link CaptchaValidationResponse} is always immutable.
