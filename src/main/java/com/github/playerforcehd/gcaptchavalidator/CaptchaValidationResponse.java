/**
 * Represents a single response of a request that was send to the siteverify servers.
 *
 * The response contains all currently defined fields as stated in Googles documentation.
 * Although, the mapping of the fields is a bit different to make it easier to work with the
 * received response on developers side.
 *
 * Mapping used by ReCaptcha Validator:
 *  - success          - succeeded
 *  - challenge_ts     - challengeTimestamp
 *  - hostname         - hostnameOrPackageName in conjunction with clientType
 *  - apk_package_name - hostnameOrPackageName in conjunction with clientType
 *  - errors           - errors
 *
 * The mapped fields are accessed through their getters:
 *   - succeeded             - {@link #hasSucceeded()}
 *   - challenge_ts          - {@link #getChallengeTimestamp()}
 *   - clientType            - {@link #getClientType()}
 *   - hostnameOrPackageName - {@link #getHostnameOrPackageName()}
 *   - errors                - {@link #getErrors()}
 *
 *  The mapping for hostname and apk_package_name works as the following:
 *   - If the hostname key is present, {@link #getClientType()} will contain {@link ClientType#WEB }
 *     and {@link #getHostnameOrPackageName()} the hostname value of the response.
 *   - If the apk_package_name key is present, {@link #getClientType()} will contain {@link ClientType#ANDROID }
 *     and {@link #getHostnameOrPackageName()} the android package name value of the response.
 *   - If both values are available, the response won't happen as the request will have been failed
 *     with an exception as the mapping cannot be applied.
 *
 * An instantiated {@link CaptchaValidationResponse} is always immutable.
